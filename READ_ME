A/B Testing

One of the most important aspects for a business is to understand its customers. It is crucial to understand what customers like,
need and what drivers their behavior.
Businesses need to ask themselves, what keeps the customers engaged, what content do they like, how do they respond to change etc.
An A/B test can help a business to get a better understanding what their customer like, want and need.

An A/B test is a statistical tool which allows us to compare two groups, the control the original testing variable) and the test group (new variable),
to see if groups statistically significant different from each other.
The A/B test is very common in marketing (to see which campaign is more efficient) or for online services
(how do the customers behave when layout of the homepage changes).


In my following projects I have performed two A/B test in Python to determine:
- Which marketing campaign is the most efficient one?
- Did a change in a mobile game app led to a different customer behavior?
