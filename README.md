# A-B_test

One of the most important aspects for a business is to understand its customers. It is crucial to understand what customers like, need and what drives their behavior.
Businesses need to ask themselves, what keeps the customers engaged, what content do they like, how do they respond to change, etc.
An A/B test can help a business to get a better understanding what their customer like, want and need.

An A/B test is a statistical tool which allows us to compare two groups, the control group (original testing variable) and the test group (new variable), to see if groups statistically significant differentiate from each other.
The A/B test is very common in marketing (to see which campaign is more effective) or for online services (how do the customers behave when the layout of the homepage changes).

In my following projects I have performed two A/B test in Python to determine:
- Which marketing campaign is the most efficient one
- Did a change in a mobile game app led to a different customer behavior (moving gate from level 30 to level 40)
